NYC Uber and Yellow Taxi data over the period of January 2009 to June 2015 are explored in this project.  The goal is to see how trends of Uber and Yellow taxis change over the time period and how these trends also relate to the weather data. In this project, Yellow Taxi data is colleted from the NYC Taxi and Limosine Commisions website.  While the weather and sampled Uber datasets were provided to us.
