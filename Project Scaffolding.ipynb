    "### Calculating distance\n",
    "In this section in order to calculate the distance between two points in the uber data, we must use the longitude and latitude of the pickup and drop off locations.  Therefore, by using math module in order to calculate the distance between these two coordinates is given in the function calculate_distance().  It is important to note that, there are more accurate ways to calculate the distance based upon longitude and latitude that do not use just the math module.  In addtion, in the taxi data sets, the distance is already calculated, however, it is given in miles, so the miles_to_km() function converts the miles to kilometers so that a direct comparison between taxis and ubers can be made.  It should also be noted that the taxi distance is a distance driving on city streets whereas the uber distance is just a birdseye view distance, therefore, the distances in the taxi data set are likely to be slightly longer.  The function, add_distance_column() can be used in order to add the calculated distance to the uber data set.  This function uses the pickup and drop off longitudes and latitudes in order to build the additional column row by row."
